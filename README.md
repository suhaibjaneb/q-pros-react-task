# SJ React Task

**Note:** I couldn't find a public API to fetch data and there was no provided one in the task, so I created one from scratch using the Next API route.

## Running the App

1- do a `nvm use` to use the correct node version.

2- install the package:

```bash
npm i
```

3- run the app:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
